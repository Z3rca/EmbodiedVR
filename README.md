# ELI - Embodied Locomotion and Interaction
previously known as  EmbodiedVR   

ELI Was a Study project based on the Hybrid Locomotion Approach for Virtual Reality at the University of Osnabrück. The goal was to investigate and explore methods of locomotion that induce a sense of embodiment and presence in the virtual environment while ensuring the well-being of the user.

In our study project we developed this environment as well as conducting an experiment based on it. 

The "Hybrid"-locomotion approach, combines a third-person view and a first-person view for interacting in the environment. The Locomotion approach was promising since it was generally liked by the participants, was less sickness-inducing, and seemed not to break the immersion.

## Paper draft
The authors created this paper that summarized the study.


## Content:
The application contains 4 areas that would simulate the general use of an interactive application. 
Area 1: usual walking in a park like area.
Area 2: interaction in a small interactive puzzle area.
Area 3: Undeliberate movement.  (moving platforms) 
Area 4: Deliberate Vertical movement.


## Usage:
The experiment will not start directly and needs to be set up first. type in a participant ID, use an order and select the condition in which you want to start. Confirm and start.

##Caution:
Do not use the Eyetracking button at the beginning of the application it will freeze the application! If you are interested in the eye-tracking recording please contact me. 

The data recording for this application may still be active. Please ensure that your AppData folder is not storing any unwanted files. 
Head to C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\LocalLow\DefaultCompany\EmbodiedVR
and delete the recorded files after your session. 

This project was made a long time ago, I personally did not check if some systems will have problems running the application. 


## Requirements: 
You need a VR device, probably a HTC Vive or Valve Index to run the application.

It is highly recommended to use Valve Index Controllers when using the application. I do not know if other controllers work.
